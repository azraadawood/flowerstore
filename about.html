        <h7>Hi there, it is nice to meet you.</h7>
        <br>
        <h8>
            I am Amanda Scott and I started my journey in 2003.
            <br>
            I had always been intrigued by the 
            beauty of flowers, 
            their vibrant colours and enchanting scents. 
            My childhood was spent in the wildflower grasslands that 
            surrounded my home, I use to explore the flowers and
            always use to dream that one day I will share
             my love for flowers with the world. 
             <br>
            The love and passion  
            I had for flowers blossomed into a deep-seated ambition
             as I grew older. 
            I decided turn my dream into reality. 
            My heart overflowing with love for blooms and an unwavering 
            entrepreneurship, I started my journey to launch 
            my own flower store, “Amour-florist.” <br> <br>
            Amour-florist sells fresh flowers that are 
            handpicked and exquisite.
             From elegant roses to joyful daisies, every flower
             whispers a tale of love and joy. I dedicated my heart 
             into hand-selecting each flower as well as designing 
             the ideal floral arrangements. I wanted 
             Amour-florist to be more than just a store 
             to buy flowers, I wanted it to be a place where people 
             could celebrate moments which are special and express their 
             emotions through the language of flowers. 
             The flowers that
             Amour-florist sells touch the hearts of everyone that 
            sees them, 
             Whether 
             it is a bouquet for a dinner party, a wedding or a 
             gesture of gratitude. <br> <br> Amour-florist 
             prospered beyond
               its success, the beauty of my store lies 
               in the smiles that it brought to others, the tears 
               that it dried and the love it gave. 
               Amour-florist 
               is more than just a store, it is a place of beauty, love
                and unlimited possibilities.<br> <br> It has been an 
                amazing journey so far, 
            Amour-florist is motivated for growth
             because we want more. 
            More for our florists. More for our customers.

            Why Amour-florist?
            

        </h7>
    <br>
        <h8>
            The French word
            "Amour" translates to "love" in English. 
            The term "Florist" 
           is someone who sells flowers and floral arrangements. 
           Amour-florist 
            means "Love Florist" or "Flower Shop of Love." 
            It is a store where 
            flowers are not only sold as products but they 
            represent love, passion 
            and care. It evokes the idea of a flower boutique 
            that customers can
            convey their affection through the lovely appearance and 
            language of flowers.
